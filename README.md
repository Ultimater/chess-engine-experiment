# chess-engine-experiment

This will be an experiment toward a different approach to a chess engine.  

I'll be designing unit tests first:  
Tactics puzzles which the engine needs to be able to solve correctly, and under certain search depth restrictions, in order to pass a given puzzle.  
Engine needs to be able to analyze a finished non-drawish game and determine where it thinks the losing side went wrong and could have changed the outcome.    
Engine needs to be able to play against itself and self-anylize, then from the completed game try to figure out where it went wrong then store its conclusions.      
All the examples it learns from should get wiped... Only the conclusions it comes up with should get stored...  
Conclusions need to be able to be tested in terms of accuracy and usefulness when analyzing completed games...   
A lot of this just sounds like AI, but AI is only as smart as the learning examples it encounters...  Will need some high quality computer chess games out there it can learn from... then over time the conclusions it finds will grow and grow.... Ultimately we just want to store the conclusions until we pretty much approach having a sort of perfect playing engine that can analyze a position and generate its moves instantaneously. Of course many positions will have multiple good moves where it's one move accomplishes something in less moves, while you want to also be able to accomplish the same thing in more moves to give your opponent more chances to blunder. I don't believe less moves is better per se like many chess engines think, but rather actually more moves because it would make it that much harder for a brute-force engine to follow the line. But it's understandable that there's a time factor if going to lose on time and accomplishing the same thing can be done in less moves, such as mating opponent with a queen with only 2 seconds left, to reduce time used on the clock to ensure a victory etc. There's many different factors, but what I'm saying is that sometimes more moves is better because it gives your opponent more moves to make and each time they move there's a chance they can blunder, and if a chain of moves is longer it's harder to see through all the moves for your opponent, and some positions are harder to play than others, etc....  
  
The end goal for this may not actually be a chess engine meant for playing a game, but more for anaylizing games and accomplishing the task without brute force.    
Ideally the engine would be able to "think" like a human and improve its game over time while establishing preferencing along the way such as fighting for the center as early as possible, coming up with a plan and predicting opponent's plan, then trying to figure out what's going on in each position. And to feel the tention in each position so it can accurately determine which side is better, etc.  

Lots of such ideas....  
Will start by creating our unit tests, test-driven development, just having a bunch of puzzle data available to help teach the engine certain tactics, etc...
Then will teach it certain completed games, just lots and lots and lots of games to have it anylize.  

The idea is to write all of this in PHP...  
Sure a poor choice of a language for this sort of task, but I want to see how far PHP can get on this task...    
This way I can learn something in terms of how to approach such tasks in PHP, and I might even discover some way to organize code along the way which I like that might find its way into more serious PHP projects such as at work with laravel and/or wordpress, etc...
